= Documentation of 🔥FireCommit

== Default Start

=== Start

When the scrip starts, you see something similar to this:

[source,shell]
--
🔥FireCommit - V.6.2
[CHECK]:  (i) Successful.
[CHECK]:  (i) Successful.
[CHECK]:  (i) Successful.
[CHECK]:  (i) Successful.
[CWD]:    ... your current working directory
[OPTION]: 0:start | 1:abort
[0|1]: 1 
--

Type `0` for actually starting and `1` for quitting. 

**NOTE**: The checks run to make sure that the two json-files are present and that the working directory is a git-repository.

=== Next

Next, it depends on how your commit-message is structured. The default one will print out:

[source,shell]
--
[topics]:
  ..0:FIX(✅)
  ..1:TEST(🛡️)
  ..2:MILE(💎)
  ..3:REL(🎆)
  ..4:DOCS(📓)
  ..5:CONN(🔗)
  ..6:REF(🔪)
  ..7:ARCHI(🏬)
  ..8:INFRA(🎛️)
  ..9:INIT(🏹)
  ..10:UP(⬆️)
  ..11:STYLE(🪟)
  ..12:FEAT(🎉)
  ..13:PERF(💯)
  ..14:CORE(🌣)
  ..15:REV(♻️)
[SELECT]:   
--

Type `0`,`1` or other numbers.

Then, it will print out:

[source,shell]
--
[INPUT]:  
--

Now you can type some keywords.

=== Done

When you're done, the script will print out:

[source,shell]
--
[OPTION]: 0:show | 1:save to file | 2:commit | 3:abort.  
--

You can see the full message printed out (`0`), you can save it to a .txt-file (`1`), you can commit (`2`) or you can abort (`3`) (exits the script).

When you're finally done, the script will start a new round (If you are familiar with Python and you don't like this behaviour, you can change that in the main-function in _FireCommit.py__).

=== Finally Done

If you abort, you will see something like this:

[source,shell]
--
[LOG]: Stopping...
🔥FireCommit Exited 
--

== Modifications

You may want to modify the commit structure. To do this, you have to modify the file __msgstruct.json__.

**NOTE**: There are two [ https://github.com/BenSt099/FireCommit/tree/main/examples/exp.adoc[examples] ] that show how this is done.

- The content of the json file will be loaded and stored in a dictionary.
- The first attribute should be: 

[source,shell]
--
"name":"your_template_name",
--

- Now you can structure your message:

=== Options

    - To select an option out of several possibilities, use:

[source,shell]
--
"some_name":"[option1,option2,option3,...]",
--

=== Seperators

    - To use a seperator (like comma, semicolon, ...), use

[source,shell]
--
"Seperator":"some_seperator",
--

    - JSON-files contain key-value-pairs. So if you want to have more then one seperator in your file,
    you have to name them like (it has to start with "Seperator..."): 

[source,shell]
--
"Seperator":"some_seperator",
...
"Seperator2":"some_seperator",
...
"Seperator3":"some_seperator",
--

=== Line Break

    - To get a line break / blank line, use

[source,shell]
--
"blank":"",
--

    - JSON-files contain key-value-pairs. So if you want to have more then one blank line in your file,
    you have to name them like (it has to start with "blank..."): 

[source,shell]
--
"blank":"",
...
"blank2":"",
...
"blank3":"",
--

=== Keyboard Input

    - To get keyboard input from the user, use

[source,shell]
--
"some_name":"input"
--

    - **NOTE**: The value "input" has to be named liked that. Do not use a different name.

=== Date & Time & Mods

    - To get the current date, use

[source,shell]
--
"date":"",
--

    - To get the current time, use

[source,shell]
--
"time":"",
--

    - To get modifications from git (`git diff --staged --stat`), use

[source,shell]
--
"mods":"",
--

**NOTE**: All of these three commands can only be used once in the message. Moreover, they have to be named exactly like that. For an example, click https://github.com/BenSt099/FireCommit/blob/main/examples/exp.adoc[here].


=== Validation

-> After the JSON-file has been saved, start the script. It automatically loads the new changes. For verification, you can take a look when the scipt starts. The script will print out:

[source,shell]
--
[CHECK]:  Loaded 'your_template_name' template.
--
