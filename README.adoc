== Features

 > The script offers an easy step-to-step protocol for generating a commit message.

 > You can directly run git commit and git push very quickly from the script.

 > If any files are unstaged, the script warns you.

 > You can get the commit message without committing. It will be written to a txt-file where you can copy it.

== Description

This simple script helps you write good git commit messages. It automatically generates a git commit in the same directory where you run it. 
Moreover, the commit message is customizable with a json-file.

== Requirements

- Python, Vesion >= 3.7 [ https://www.python.org/downloads/[Installation] ]

== Installation

In your git repository, add the following to your `.gitignore` : 

[source,shell]
--
commitmsg/
--

Then, make a commit.

Next, create a directory in your project's folder named `commitmsg`. Furthermore, add 
__FireCommitScript.py__  and __defaultmsg.json__ into the directory you just created. See **Usage** for starting the script.

== Usage

- For Windows:

[source,powershell]
--
./FireCommitScript.py
--

- For Linux:

[source,shell]
--
python3 FireCommitScript.py
--

- For MacOS:

== Documentation

- The script is mostly self-explaining and guides you through every step
- If you still need some help, type "op" for displaying options when the script starts.
- For the full documentation, click https://github.com/BenSt099/FireCommit/blob/main/docs/docs.adoc[here].

== Known Issues

1. Committing Without Adding

    - The script warns you if some files are unstaged but it doesn't
      include those files into the commit. You have to manually add them to the staging area.

2. Unexpected Result When Running ``git log``

    - When writing a verbose commit message, a compromise must be made regarding the readability of the git log.

    - If you run `git log`, you may see a large amount of text that would fill up pages.

    - Using `git shortlog` will not help:

To search for single commits more easily, use

[source,shell]
----
git log --pretty=format:"%cn committed %h on %cd with Topic: %f"
----

or similar modifications.
