== Description

In large projects it's important to use verbose and structured commit messages. This can be challenging when working in a big team with many
developers. The provided script helps you with that. 

== Requirements

- Python, Vesion >= 3.7 [ https://www.python.org/downloads/[Installation] ]
- TKinter

== Installation

In your git repository, create a directory named `commitmsg`. Furthermore, add 
the provided files https://github.com/BenSt099/FireCommit/releases[See Latest Release] into the directory you just created. See **Usage** for starting the script.

When working under Linux, you may have to install tkinter separately because it is not integrated in regular Python:

[source,powershell]
--
sudo apt-get install python3-tk (Debian)

sudo dnf install python3-tkinter (Fedora)

sudo pacman -S tk (Arch)
--

== Usage

- For Windows:

[source,powershell]
--
./FireCommitScript.py
--

- For Linux:

[source,shell]
--
python3 FireCommitScript.py
--

- For MacOS:

== Documentation

- The script is mostly self-explaining and guides you through every step.
- If you still need some help, type "op" for displaying options when the script starts.
- For the full documentation, click https://github.com/BenSt099/FireCommit/blob/main/docs/docs.adoc[here].

== Known Issues

1. Committing Without Adding

    - The script warns you if some files are unstaged but it doesn't
      include those files into the commit. You have to manually add them to the staging area.

2. Unexpected Result When Running ``git log``

    - When writing a verbose commit message, a compromise must be made regarding the readability of the git log.

    - If you run `git log`, you may see a large amount of text that would fill up pages.

    - Using `git shortlog` will not help:

To search for single commits more easily, use

[source,shell]
----
git log --pretty=format:"%cn committed %h on %cd with Topic: %f"
----

or similar modifications.
